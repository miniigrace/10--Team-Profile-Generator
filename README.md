# 10 --Team Profile Generator

## Project Task and Descritpion

My task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable by writing a unit test for every part of the code and ensure that it passes each test.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```
## Mock-Up

The following images show the web application's appearance and functionality:
