# 10 --Team Profile Generator

## Project Task and Descritpion

My task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable by writing a unit test for every part of the code and ensure that it passes each test.
